  Review Title:   Great performance with lower TDP makes system awesome!
  Review Body:    Unless you have an older system, if you focus on just performance you will be disappointed.  The performance uplift alone, going from a 7000 series CPU to an equivalent 9000 series, isn't enough to justify the price and effort.  What you do get though from such an upgrade is everything else you get such as lower TDP.  The 7000 series had 170W TDP while this drops to 120W.  The result is a CPU which runs cooler and uses far less power.  This leads to fans running slower leading to a much quitter system.  I can't believe how quite my system is now compared to when I had a 7900x; my gaming experience is really enhanced.  I can't hear anything at all anymore.  Plus, there is far less heat coming from my system so my room is cooler.  So, there are  benefits that go beyond just a mere increases in FPS during video game play.  

Ultimately, those benefits combined with the performance uplift you do get results in a total package that's hard to beat.   Keep that in mind if you are simply upgrading from a 7000 series to this.  For new installs or persons upgrading from ancient equipment, this is a no brainer.

  Additional Details: Pros: - Great performance
- Low TDP
- Backwards compatible with older cooling solutions
- 12 cores
- I am using an AM5 Asus board and was upgrading; I upgraded the BIOS to make sure I had the latest greatest, took out the old processor and put in the new one.  Simple.
- It's rock solid and just works.  Plain and simple., Cons: - I upgraded from a Ryzen 9 7900x to this one.  My main games are [currently] Battlefield 2042 and Flight Simulator.  I am getting about 10 fps uplift in each of them.   Good but not great.  Modern games rely on vid cards more than CPU so I wasn't expecting much thank goodness.  If you are upgrading like me and looking for a major uplift, you won't get it., Voting: 15, Consented: 15

  Review Body:    This is my first time using Ryzen CPU. I used to be Intel Fanboy, but due to their issue with 13th and 14 gen CPUs, I decided to give Ryzen a shot. So far, I am really happy with this CPU. I am mainly using this CPU for gaming and coding. During normal tasks, I am averaging around 50C temperature. During gaming, I am averaging around 65C.

  Review Title:   Don't worry about it getting hot
  Review Body:    It does what a CPU is designed to do, and it's pretty darn good at it. 

Do note that these latest generations are designed to ramp up power consumption, and therefore temperature, as quickly as it can to process as fast as it can.  This means, any tasks that use 100% CPU will cause the CPU to go up to 100℃ almost immediately.  If your fan curves are set to go to max at 100℃ (which they usually are by default), then you're going to have a rather noisy computer.  But you can lower your fan curves to not go at max, and the CPU will throttle itself so that it still doesn't go above 100℃.

  Review Body:    I use to be an intel user, but I Don't recommend the 14th gen, instead get 7800x3D. I regret my choice. Hopefully I can get a refund and swap to the other CPU.

Otherwise you can wait for 15th gen Intel for a potentially better option.

  Review Title:   About 10x faster than a 6th Gen Core i5
  Review Body:    I bought this to upgrade a Core i9-9900k in someone's system. I would have gone with a 14900k but the user is just gaming and running photoshop. Don't get me wrong, the i9-9900k is still a strong CPU, but the user wants an upgrade for running a high refresh rate monitor.

  Review Date:    2024-03-31T20:16:15.02
  Verified Buyer: True
  Additional Details: Pros: After I bought this, a friend asked how much faster the 14700k is in comparison to his older Core i5-6500. Since I have overclocked and non-overclocked scores for a 6600k saved to the CPU-Z database, I was able to check.

In the CPU-Z v.17 benchmark a 6th Gen i5 or i7 typically scores around 450 to 500 in the single-core benchmark, and the i5 scores somewhere around 1500 to maybe 2000 in the multithreaded benchmark, depending on the clock frequency and XMP. The 14700k on the other hand scores around 900 points in the single-core benchmark and around 14500 in the multithreaded benchmark. It's really amazing to see how much better these late Raptor Lake processors are in comparison to all of these 14nm Skylake based processors.

I still have an i5-6600k that can hit 4.8GHz with the RAM tuned at 3000MT/s and it scores around 500 points in the CPU-Z single-core benchmark, and about 2000 points in the multithreaded score. 

I'm using this with an Asus board and the SP scores are a bit above average. I think the combined SP score is around 78 and the MC SP score is 76., Cons: It consumes a lot of power and the 14700k really needs a good 280mm AIO. A large Air-Cooler is doable, but I'd have to under-volt and tune it to make it work right with a larger twin-tower heatsink. 

No upgrade path. Who is really going to upgrade from a 14700k to a 14900k? 

I'm running this with Hynix-A die 7200MT/s 32GB RAM. I can boot into the OS and run everything with XMP enabled. I have not tried any real memory stress tests like Karhu to see if it's 100% stable. Speaking to whoever is reading this. If you go beyond 6400MT/s, then it's worth stress testing your RAM to make sure it's stable. If you're using a motherboard with four memory slots, then don't expect to go blazing through with DDR5-8000 RAM. You really need a 1 DIMM per channel board for that sort of thing., Voting: 4, Consented: 4

  Review Title:   Excellent CPU, fast, stable, and runs cool.
  Review Body:    The PC I built 14 years ago using an Intel Sandy Bridge i5 2500k is still running strong and if it wasn't for Window no supporting 7 I'd still be using it. I never overclocked it and always kept the cpu under water cooling trying to maintain temp below 60 degrees C. 4 years later I upgraded to an i7 3770, which had to be bought used, and it is still running strong. Both PCs have been excellent and capable of doing everything I needed.

Those CPU's had much lower TDP than the i7 14700K but then again they only had 4 cores. So far I haven't pushed this cpu hard and don't know whether there are any stability issues and I suspect Intel has sorted the motherboard BIOS settings that has allowed these 13th and 14th gen processors to not function properly.

One advantage of the unfortunate disconnect between motherboard products and the 13th/14th gen is the bad press around these CPU's that has resulted in Intel heavily discounted prices.

Due to my positive experience with the Intel Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge processors and the compelling discounts I've taken the risk with the 13th/14th gen CPU's.

Note to anyone buying a 14th generation Intel core. This will work on most 12th and 13th generation Motherboards. be sure to confirm that the board you select has a viable bios update via the manufacturers website and to install the bios update via flashdrive before CPU install. 

I returned a perfectly good motherboard due to this instead of just returning the RAM and updating the Bios.

  Review Title:   Great Processor. Very Power Hungry.
  Review Body:    Due to my set up, I have a strict power-limit. Good thing is, the advertised power limit is within that limit. Bad thing is, Turbo goes up 300 Watts. Had to knee cap its max power usage to 130 Watts, so it can only reach 5 GHz on the P-Cores and 4GHz on the E-Cores for me. Good thing(?) is that doesnt really impact how its performance feels and doesnt significantly hurt its benchmark score.
I would buy again. That said, there really needs to be a change in the approach to Turbo in future chips. Doubling the power usage from what its advertised to use just feels wrong. 25% seems like the right amount of increase. 50% for the top-line.

  Additional Details: Pros: I power limit to 225w, and undervolt -0.100 across the entire chip. This keeps temps under 78c in any situation on big air coolers and under 70c on 280mm AIOs. 

Right now I have this stacked with an MSI z790 tomahawk wifi max, which was an emergency purchase from best buy, my asrock died. But its been 100% good with this CPU and undervolt etc...

Most people will not utilize these cpu's fully outside of rendering video, compiling apps, machine learning and testing via CPU prior to cuda/rocm runs. I came from a Ryzen 5900X and before that an i7-3770. I undervolted from day 1 so I missed all the chip self delete issues that have been surfacing this year. I think the 13/14th gen and probably the new Ultra 2 will satisfy most compute requirements for another couple generations. Frame chasers will always demand the highest clocks and latest tech but for video editing, daily work, machine learning, non-obsessive gaming this i7 or the i9 is pretty good.

FYI I have also utilized an anti bend frame day 1 as well. So I do not have any experience on this gen without having a good flat-ish cpu., Cons: , Voting: 2, Consented: 2

  Review Title:   Handled everything so far
  Review Body:    At the time I was between this and the 7800X3D as the prices were close, the AM5 is an evolving CPU pathway while LGA1700 is being replaced. At the time of purchase information about Intel 13th and 14th gen CPUs was not released (but speculated on by some online journalists with the i9). The bigger issue was the single and multi-core processing of the two gave a significant advantage to Intel, and since my main priority is work related functions, I sacrificed a few FPS for rendering times.

  Review Body:    a lot of people say 14th gen sucks but if you are upgrading from 10th or 11th gen it makes a huge difference.

 I got this mainly for 3D design (zbrush, Blender, Clo). I had 10700k before.  it is so much faster. zbrush is smooth with models with 100s of milions of polygons which is crazy. fabric rendering in Clo is almost real time. ive never seen that before. 

 but what i was surprised by was how much it improved gaming. COD got nearly 2X the performance  for me. frame times feel very steady for almost all games I had issues with before. 

only thing is it can get hot. in games it never really gets over like 50 degrees. but if you are rendering an animation it can get to like 80 or 90 degrees. i have a 240mm AIO cooler which is doing the job but I feel like it couldnt hurt to upgrade my cooling set up. 

but overall this was a great purchase. if you havent upgraded in awhile this is a great time too. especially with 15th gen looking like it might alien gamers.

  Review Body:    I honestly couldnt recommend this to anyone. Especially not for the price. I spent so many hours trying to figure out the things that were wrong with this thing while also spending money on new paste, watching countless videos on why my performance was awful, monitoring my games and temps for hours, updating drivers, the bios, and chipsets hoping to fix the issues. On top of all this the intel lines always only have one board and can never be upgraded after that generation is done. I understand the idea behind needing a new platform for performance but they cant seem to do it right the first time and just look forward to the next project! Switching to team red 💯

  Additional Details: Pros: Im gonna be honest this thing outside of gaming is fine after you lower the wattage to the recommended( which you had to go into the bios and do yourself). Im sure it could be a solid cpu for normal work loads, Cons: This thing sucks for gaming. Im gonna be honest Ive never had something have more microstutters ever. I had a better time with consistency on my i9 9900k.

Unless you go into the bios and tweak this thing to fix the voltages its actually a frying pan. Before I got it fixed I was constantly hitting well over 90C sometimes capping out at.100C under and AIO(Corsair 1H00x), Voting: 5, Consented: 4

Update: running at 10-15% load processor is 60-65* C and fan is blasting away @ 2100 RPM.  At 8% load, runs in the low 50's.  Yes, fan is correctly installed with high quality thermal paste.

  Review Title:   Read Before You Buy
  Review Body:    The reality of these 13th and 14th generation Intel processors; is that Intel still sells them while completely understanding that they are at fault. I bought this processor on 11/30/23 and it's been nothing but trouble ever since. Constant BSoD's with event viewer pointing every direction with errors. Initially the information given about these issues for these processors was very slim. Almost as if Intel wanted their customers to be kept in the dark about the situation. Which is exactly what happened. I finally had an error in event viewer which was event ID 17 (Sometimes the crashes would only provide me with dump files to debug), and the hardware ID matched the CPU bridge of my Intel i7-14700k. I've been through 2 RMA's in hopes that they've been trying to work through it. Always been on top of updating my bios, never overclocked the CPU, checked temperatures, etc. to leave out as much error as humanly possible. They will continue to try to stabilize this mess with new firmware, but the damage has already been done to their processors (which seems to be permanent) and their relations with customers. Overall, I would say that if you enjoy running into several BSoD's a day; even while your system is running idle, then most definitely choose an Intel Core i7-14700K. Or really any 13th or 14th gen Intel processor apparently. Also, if you're currently dealing with the same issues in your product, please do yourself a favor and get a refund from Intel. You absolutely deserve it.

  Review Title:   Great performance with lower TDP makes system awesome!
  Review Body:    Unless you have an older system, if you focus on just performance you will be disappointed.  The performance uplift alone, going from a 7000 series CPU to an equivalent 9000 series, isn't enough to justify the price and effort.  What you do get though from such an upgrade is everything else you get such as lower TDP.  The 7000 series had 170W TDP while this drops to 120W.  The result is a CPU which runs cooler and uses far less power.  This leads to fans running slower leading to a much quitter system.  I can't believe how quite my system is now compared to when I had a 7900x; my gaming experience is really enhanced.  I can't hear anything at all anymore.  Plus, there is far less heat coming from my system so my room is cooler.  So, there are  benefits that go beyond just a mere increases in FPS during video game play.  

Ultimately, those benefits combined with the performance uplift you do get results in a total package that's hard to beat.   Keep that in mind if you are simply upgrading from a 7000 series to this.  For new installs or persons upgrading from ancient equipment, this is a no brainer.

- Low TDP
- Backwards compatible with older cooling solutions
- 12 cores
- I am using an AM5 Asus board and was upgrading; I upgraded the BIOS to make sure I had the latest greatest, took out the old processor and put in the new one.  Simple.
- It's rock solid and just works.  Plain and simple., Cons: - I upgraded from a Ryzen 9 7900x to this one.  My main games are [currently] Battlefield 2042 and Flight Simulator.  I am getting about 10 fps uplift in each of them.   Good but not great.  Modern games rely on vid cards more than CPU so I wasn't expecting much thank goodness.  If you are upgrading like me and looking for a major uplift, you won't get it., Voting: 15, Consented: 15

  Review Title:   Don't worry about it getting hot
  Review Body:    It does what a CPU is designed to do, and it's pretty darn good at it. 

Do note that these latest generations are designed to ramp up power consumption, and therefore temperature, as quickly as it can to process as fast as it can.  This means, any tasks that use 100% CPU will cause the CPU to go up to 100℃ almost immediately.  If your fan curves are set to go to max at 100℃ (which they usually are by default), then you're going to have a rather noisy computer.  But you can lower your fan curves to not go at max, and the CPU will throttle itself so that it still doesn't go above 100℃.

  Review Title:   About 10x faster than a 6th Gen Core i5
  Review Body:    I bought this to upgrade a Core i9-9900k in someone's system. I would have gone with a 14900k but the user is just gaming and running photoshop. Don't get me wrong, the i9-9900k is still a strong CPU, but the user wants an upgrade for running a high refresh rate monitor.

The system is a

WD SN850X 2TB
  Review Date:    2024-03-31T20:16:15.02
  Verified Buyer: True
  Additional Details: Pros: After I bought this, a friend asked how much faster the 14700k is in comparison to his older Core i5-6500. Since I have overclocked and non-overclocked scores for a 6600k saved to the CPU-Z database, I was able to check.

In the CPU-Z v.17 benchmark a 6th Gen i5 or i7 typically scores around 450 to 500 in the single-core benchmark, and the i5 scores somewhere around 1500 to maybe 2000 in the multithreaded benchmark, depending on the clock frequency and XMP. The 14700k on the other hand scores around 900 points in the single-core benchmark and around 14500 in the multithreaded benchmark. It's really amazing to see how much better these late Raptor Lake processors are in comparison to all of these 14nm Skylake based processors.

I still have an i5-6600k that can hit 4.8GHz with the RAM tuned at 3000MT/s and it scores around 500 points in the CPU-Z single-core benchmark, and about 2000 points in the multithreaded score. 

I'm using this with an Asus board and the SP scores are a bit above average. I think the combined SP score is around 78 and the MC SP score is 76., Cons: It consumes a lot of power and the 14700k really needs a good 280mm AIO. A large Air-Cooler is doable, but I'd have to under-volt and tune it to make it work right with a larger twin-tower heatsink. 

No upgrade path. Who is really going to upgrade from a 14700k to a 14900k? 

I'm running this with Hynix-A die 7200MT/s 32GB RAM. I can boot into the OS and run everything with XMP enabled. I have not tried any real memory stress tests like Karhu to see if it's 100% stable. Speaking to whoever is reading this. If you go beyond 6400MT/s, then it's worth stress testing your RAM to make sure it's stable. If you're using a motherboard with four memory slots, then don't expect to go blazing through with DDR5-8000 RAM. You really need a 1 DIMM per channel board for that sort of thing., Voting: 4, Consented: 4

  Review Title:   Excellent CPU, fast, stable, and runs cool.
  Review Body:    The PC I built 14 years ago using an Intel Sandy Bridge i5 2500k is still running strong and if it wasn't for Window no supporting 7 I'd still be using it. I never overclocked it and always kept the cpu under water cooling trying to maintain temp below 60 degrees C. 4 years later I upgraded to an i7 3770, which had to be bought used, and it is still running strong. Both PCs have been excellent and capable of doing everything I needed.

Those CPU's had much lower TDP than the i7 14700K but then again they only had 4 cores. So far I haven't pushed this cpu hard and don't know whether there are any stability issues and I suspect Intel has sorted the motherboard BIOS settings that has allowed these 13th and 14th gen processors to not function properly.

One advantage of the unfortunate disconnect between motherboard products and the 13th/14th gen is the bad press around these CPU's that has resulted in Intel heavily discounted prices.

Due to my positive experience with the Intel Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge processors and the compelling discounts I've taken the risk with the 13th/14th gen CPU's.

  Review Body:    Decent CPU, have yet to install due to waiting on further components and wiring harness building. 

Note to anyone buying a 14th generation Intel core. This will work on most 12th and 13th generation Motherboards. be sure to confirm that the board you select has a viable bios update via the manufacturers website and to install the bios update via flashdrive before CPU install. 

I returned a perfectly good motherboard due to this instead of just returning the RAM and updating the Bios. 

Oh well that's what makes learning something new "fun" I guess. Lol

  Review Title:   Great Processor. Very Power Hungry.
  Review Body:    Due to my set up, I have a strict power-limit. Good thing is, the advertised power limit is within that limit. Bad thing is, Turbo goes up 300 Watts. Had to knee cap its max power usage to 130 Watts, so it can only reach 5 GHz on the P-Cores and 4GHz on the E-Cores for me. Good thing(?) is that doesnt really impact how its performance feels and doesnt significantly hurt its benchmark score.
I would buy again. That said, there really needs to be a change in the approach to Turbo in future chips. Doubling the power usage from what its advertised to use just feels wrong. 25% seems like the right amount of increase. 50% for the top-line.

  Additional Details: Pros: I power limit to 225w, and undervolt -0.100 across the entire chip. This keeps temps under 78c in any situation on big air coolers and under 70c on 280mm AIOs. 

Right now I have this stacked with an MSI z790 tomahawk wifi max, which was an emergency purchase from best buy, my asrock died. But its been 100% good with this CPU and undervolt etc...

Most people will not utilize these cpu's fully outside of rendering video, compiling apps, machine learning and testing via CPU prior to cuda/rocm runs. I came from a Ryzen 5900X and before that an i7-3770. I undervolted from day 1 so I missed all the chip self delete issues that have been surfacing this year. I think the 13/14th gen and probably the new Ultra 2 will satisfy most compute requirements for another couple generations. Frame chasers will always demand the highest clocks and latest tech but for video editing, daily work, machine learning, non-obsessive gaming this i7 or the i9 is pretty good.

FYI I have also utilized an anti bend frame day 1 as well. So I do not have any experience on this gen without having a good flat-ish cpu., Cons: , Voting: 2, Consented: 2

  Review Title:   Handled everything so far
  Review Body:    At the time I was between this and the 7800X3D as the prices were close, the AM5 is an evolving CPU pathway while LGA1700 is being replaced. At the time of purchase information about Intel 13th and 14th gen CPUs was not released (but speculated on by some online journalists with the i9). The bigger issue was the single and multi-core processing of the two gave a significant advantage to Intel, and since my main priority is work related functions, I sacrificed a few FPS for rendering times.

  Additional Details: Pros: Decent processor when it wasn't self-immolating, Cons: Intel sold these processors with the full knowledge they would damage themselves and won't even do a recall. Hope they enjoy the money they saved from that because this is the last Intel product I'm ever purchasing., Voting: 1, Consented: 1

  Review Title:   The sweet spot for this generation
  Review Body:    The 14th Gen CPUs are somewhat of a mixed bag with many of them not really offering much from the previous generation (except a higher price, of course.)  This one is in the sweet spot where you actually get something for the additional money, and in addition when not working hard the power consumption is extremely low, thus so is your power bill.  I like it.

  Verified Buyer: True
  Additional Details: Pros: Idles VERY low on power consumption (single-digit wattage) yet has the power if you need it.
For the price a reasonable level of performance., Cons: Buy a good (e.g. Noctura) cooler -- this thing can and WILL go well beyond its placarded TDP when pressed, and if you don't have the cooling required its going to throttle., Voting: 1, Consented: 1

  Review Title:   Great CPU for the Price, not cheapest, but great performance
  Review Body:    nearly as much performance as the 14900K, but with fewer E cores and slightly lower Boost clock. but honestly nowadays you wont be CPU bottlenecking for the price difference.

  Review Title:   So far, so good
  Review Body:    Drop in upgrade from 12700K went off without a hitch. Temps are decent once I tuned it in mobo settings- PL1 and PL2 at 253 and 307 ICCMAX and adaptive offset vcore at -0.080. Perfectly stable so far and relatively cool, although my settings will reduce all-core boost around 200MHZ which makes hardly any difference since now it doesn't thermal throttle ever. Default motherboard settings draw ridiculous power and my 240 AIO cannot cool it.

  Review Title:   Great upgrade from 10th gen
  Review Body:    a lot of people say 14th gen sucks but if you are upgrading from 10th or 11th gen it makes a huge difference.

 I got this mainly for 3D design (zbrush, Blender, Clo). I had 10700k before.  it is so much faster. zbrush is smooth with models with 100s of milions of polygons which is crazy. fabric rendering in Clo is almost real time. ive never seen that before. 

 but what i was surprised by was how much it improved gaming. COD got nearly 2X the performance  for me. frame times feel very steady for almost all games I had issues with before. 

only thing is it can get hot. in games it never really gets over like 50 degrees. but if you are rendering an animation it can get to like 80 or 90 degrees. i have a 240mm AIO cooler which is doing the job but I feel like it couldnt hurt to upgrade my cooling set up. 

but overall this was a great purchase. if you havent upgraded in awhile this is a great time too. especially with 15th gen looking like it might alien gamers.

  Review Title:   Degrades over time
  Review Body:    I've had to battle this chip since I bought it in November 2023.  It's constantly having stability problems.  It works more often than not for gaming workloads that lightly use cores.  It struggles with long running compute tasks like compiling software or cinebench.  I've had frequently compiler crashes and OS crashes.  It's unstable in two different operating systems.  

I spent a lot of money troubleshooting the build including replacing the PSU, replacing the water block, adding two more radiators, various bios settings, and other time wasted.  

If you are doing tasks that don't tax the CPU for long, it might be OK.  Do not buy this for long running CPU heavy tasks.  It's just not reliable.

  Additional Details: Pros: Gaming performance was really good when first installed.  I saw a 10-30 fps uplift vs old build with 3950x.  (other parts mostly the same), Cons: - Unstable CPU.  Constantly have to slow it down, tweak voltage and other settings to keep it working
- Much slower than various benchmarks claim
- Compiler performance is terrible.  
- Intel recommended settings cause a 10% performance hit off the top, Voting: 6, Consented: 5

  Review Title:   Worst CPU Ive used probably ever (especially for gaming).
  Review Body:    I honestly couldnt recommend this to anyone. Especially not for the price. I spent so many hours trying to figure out the things that were wrong with this thing while also spending money on new paste, watching countless videos on why my performance was awful, monitoring my games and temps for hours, updating drivers, the bios, and chipsets hoping to fix the issues. On top of all this the intel lines always only have one board and can never be upgraded after that generation is done. I understand the idea behind needing a new platform for performance but they cant seem to do it right the first time and just look forward to the next project! Switching to team red 💯

  Additional Details: Pros: Im gonna be honest this thing outside of gaming is fine after you lower the wattage to the recommended( which you had to go into the bios and do yourself). Im sure it could be a solid cpu for normal work loads, Cons: This thing sucks for gaming. Im gonna be honest Ive never had something have more microstutters ever. I had a better time with consistency on my i9 9900k.

Unless you go into the bios and tweak this thing to fix the voltages its actually a frying pan. Before I got it fixed I was constantly hitting well over 90C sometimes capping out at.100C under and AIO(Corsair 1H00x), Voting: 5, Consented: 4

  Review Title:   Read Before You Buy
  Review Body:    The reality of these 13th and 14th generation Intel processors; is that Intel still sells them while completely understanding that they are at fault. I bought this processor on 11/30/23 and it's been nothing but trouble ever since. Constant BSoD's with event viewer pointing every direction with errors. Initially the information given about these issues for these processors was very slim. Almost as if Intel wanted their customers to be kept in the dark about the situation. Which is exactly what happened. I finally had an error in event viewer which was event ID 17 (Sometimes the crashes would only provide me with dump files to debug), and the hardware ID matched the CPU bridge of my Intel i7-14700k. I've been through 2 RMA's in hopes that they've been trying to work through it. Always been on top of updating my bios, never overclocked the CPU, checked temperatures, etc. to leave out as much error as humanly possible. They will continue to try to stabilize this mess with new firmware, but the damage has already been done to their processors (which seems to be permanent) and their relations with customers. Overall, I would say that if you enjoy running into several BSoD's a day; even while your system is running idle, then most definitely choose an Intel Core i7-14700K. Or really any 13th or 14th gen Intel processor apparently. Also, if you're currently dealing with the same issues in your product, please do yourself a favor and get a refund from Intel. You absolutely deserve it.
